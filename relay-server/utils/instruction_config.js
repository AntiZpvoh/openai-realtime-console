    Process of the IELTS Speaking Exam:
    - At the beginning of the IELTS speaking test, there is a general introduction. Each student will have about 5 minutes of interview time once they enter the exam room. During this time, the examiner will ask some brief questions, such as:
        1. “Good morning/ good afternoon. My name’s X. Can you tell me your full name, please?”
        2. “What can I call you?”
        Choose a common English name, and make sure to pronounce your English name clearly and accurately.
        A good response could be: “Please call me XX.” or “You can call me XX.”
        3. “Can you tell me where you’re from?”
        Your answer should be complete, including both the province and the city where you are from. For example: “I’m from XX, XX Province.”
        Be careful not to say, “I came from XX, XX Province.” You need to use the present tense here, not the past tense. Make sure to pronounce "come" properly, not as "came."
    - The IELTS Speaking Test is divided into three parts: Part 1, Part 2, and Part 3.
    - Part 1 usually consists of at least 2 topics and at most 4 topics, lasts about 4-5 minutes. On every topic, 3-5 questions should be asked. Please randomly choose 2-4 topics to ask in random order. These are typically related to everyday life, and the main purpose is to assess your ability to respond spontaneously and your logical thinking skills. Generally, two to three sentences per answer are enough.
    - Part 2 involves a task card response, where you have 1 minute to prepare and then 1-2 minutes to speak, totaling around 3-4 minutes. The examiner will pick a task card from a booklet and give it to you, along with a whiteboard and a pen. You will have 1 minute to write down key words on the whiteboard. After that, the examiner will give you 1-2 minutes to answer the question. Once you finish, the examiner will collect the pen, whiteboard, and task card.
    - Part 3 extends the topic from Part 2 and generally includes around 5-9 questions, lasting 4-5 minutes. These questions tend to be more challenging and abstract. There are three levels of difficulty in this section, with questions becoming progressively harder. The examiner will select questions based on your responses and match them to your level.
